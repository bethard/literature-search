<h1>About the Literature Search Demo</h1>
<p>
This is a demo of a literature search system over the Thomson Reuters Web of Knowledge.
The demo runs over a subset of the Web of Knowledge that is targeted at prematurity research,
though the same system is capable of running over the entire dataset.
</p>

<h2>Better Search from Citation Analysis</h2>
<p>
Most literature search systems you're already familiar with
rely heavily on the keywords you type into the search box.
Such keywords are useful, but far from a complete description of a scientific query.
Good researchers rely on many additional factors to find good research articles:
the number of times an article was cited,
how recently an article was published,
the impact of the journal in which the article was published,
etc.
So a good literature search system should incorporate all these factors too.
But how can a computer know how to put all these factors together effectively?
</p>
<p>
Our answer, and one of the key innovations of this literature search demo,
is to teach the computer to <i>learn</i> to combine the factors
by observing <i>citation patterns</i> in research articles.
The system looks at the bibliographies of research articles,
and analyzes them for clues about how the researchers decided on what to cite.
For example, if researchers tend to reference articles that are highly cited,
then the system learns to boost articles with large citation counts.
Or, if researchers tend to reference articles published recently,
then the system learns to boost articles that were published a small number of years ago. 
</p>
<p>
The result is a smarter literature search system that makes more accurate recommendations for you. 
</p>

<h2>Personalize Your Search System</h2>
<p>
The main search interface of the demo shows sliders for each literature search factor
(citation count, age, etc.).
The default weights are the result of training the system on a set of research articles on prematurity.
You can change these weights to fit your needs, for example,
focusing more on highly cited articles by increasing the citation count weight,
or getting rid of the bias towards recent articles by moving the age weight back to zero.
</p>
<p>
But why fiddle with weights, when the system can do that for you!
Just go to the <a href="train.html">trainer</a> page,
give it a list of articles that are good examples of your citation practices,
and it will give you back a set of weights which defines your own personalized search system.
