<h1>Train a Literature Search Model</h1>
<p>
The first step in training a model is to select a set of articles that demonstrate good citation
habits for your field.
Your goal is to find articles that are representative of your area of research, and more
importantly, have excellent bibliographies.
The system learns its literature search model by comparing an article's contents against each of
the articles in its bibliography.
</p>

<h2>1. Search for articles</h2>
<p>
We'll assume that you know the titles for a number of appropriate articles.
Please use the search below to find your articles in the index.
When you find an article, click the "Use for training" button beside it to add it to the training
data.
If you make a mistake, you can click the "Remove from training" button beside an article to remove
it from the training data.
</p>

<div>
<input type="text" id="query" name="query" size="80" />
<input type="submit" id="submit" value="Search the Web of Knowledge" />
</div>
<div id="search-results"></div>

<h2>2. Create a list of articles</h2>
<div id="no-articles-selected">
<p>No articles selected yet</p>
</div>
<div id="articles-selected"></div>

<h2>3. Train a model</h2>
<div id="no-training-allowed">
<p>You must select at least 10 articles before training a model.</p>
</div>
<div id="training-allowed">
<p>
You may now click the button below to begin training. This will take several minutes.
Please be patient. Go and get a coffee or something. ;-)
